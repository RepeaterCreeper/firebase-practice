# Sikret - Anonymous Messaging
Sikret is my first ever firebase project! The purpose of this is to be able to send anonymous messaging to other people without them knowing who sent it, this way you can say anything you wanted to say to them as if you didn't know them.

## Bugs / Issues
- [CRITICAL] Users can retrieve the name of the person that sent the message.

## How to Use
1. Visit the [website](https://sikret-5fac5.firebaseapp.com/).
2. Sign in with either Facebook or Google.
3. Share your link with your friends.
4. Wait for the messages.
5. (OPTIONAL) My share link if you wish to try it: [https://sikret-5fac5.firebaseapp.com?code=Rd6savcgeVMUqqhng0dJJziCBeD3](https://sikret-5fac5.firebaseapp.com?code=Rd6savcgeVMUqqhng0dJJziCBeD3)
